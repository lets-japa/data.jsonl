{"prompt": "I think I\u2019m exempt, why are you asking me for a medical exam?", "completion": "IRCC may need a medical exam from you to assess your application, even if you only: lived in certain countries and territories for less than 6 months, or will be in Canada for less than 6 months. If you need one, IRCC will send you instructions on how to get your medical exam done. You must go for your medical exam within 30 days of receiving these instructions, or IRCC may refuse your application."}
{"prompt": "What do I need to work in Canada?", "completion": "It depends on, the job you want to do, the program you want to apply for, whether or not your job requires a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). In most cases, you\u2019ll need 1 or more of the following documents to apply for a work permit: an LMIA number from your employer if your job needs an LMIA, proof that your employer has submitted an offer of employment through the Employer Portal, an employment contract or letter (if your employer is exempt from the employer compliance process), proof that you are certified, accredited or qualified to work in the job you want, In some cases, you might be exempt from an LMIA: where Mobilit\u00e9 Francophone allows Canadian employers to hire French-speaking and bilingual workers from abroad to work outside of Quebec in managerial, professional and technical occupations and skilled trades. If you are between 18 and 35 years old, you might be eligible for a temporary work permit under International Experience Canada."}
{"prompt": "What is an Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)?", "completion": "A Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) is a document that an employer in Canada may need to get before hiring a foreign worker. A positive LMIA will show that there is a need for a foreign worker to fill the job. It will also show that no Canadian worker or permanent resident is available to do the job. A positive LMIA is sometimes called a confirmation letter. If the employer needs an LMIA, they must apply for one. Once an employer gets the LMIA, the worker can apply for a work permit. To apply for a work permit, a worker needs a job offer letter, a contract, a copy of the LMIA, and the LMIA number"}
{"prompt": "What is considered work?", "completion": "IRCC defines work as any activity that; you are paid to do, or you are not paid to do but is a job that: you would usually be paid for, or would be a valuable work experience for a Canadian citizen or permanent resident (for example, an unpaid intern). Pay includes money or commission: an employer gives you, you receive for a service, or you receive for any other activity. You usually need a work permit to work in Canada. Most people need a work permit to work in Canada. If you need a work permit, you may be eligible for either an An employer-specific work permit allows you to work according to the conditions on your work permit, which include: the name of the employer you can work for how long you can work and the location where you can work (if applicable). On the other hand, an open work permit allows you to work for any employer in Canada, except for an employer: who is listed as ineligible on the list of employers who have failed to comply with the conditions or who regularly offers striptease, erotic dance, escort services or erotic massages. You can only get an open work permit in specific situations."}
{"prompt": "Can I hold 2 valid work permits at the same time?", "completion": "Yes, you can hold 2 valid work permits at the same time. Although, you must meet the conditions listed on each work permit. If you\u2019re issued a new work permit, your previous work permit remains valid until either it expires or a removal order is enforced. IRCC defines a removal order as when an immigration official orders a person to leave Canada. There are three types of removal orders (departure, exclusion and deportation) and each one has different consequences."}
{"prompt": "I have received a Canadian job offer. What documents do I need from my future employer?", "completion": "In most cases, the employer must send you: the job offer and a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) number; or the offer of employment number. Once you have one of these numbers, you can apply to get, extend or modify a work permit. If the employer is LMIA-exempt, find out how to get a work permit for these jobs. If you apply for an open work permit, you don\u2019t need to provide any documents from an employer."}
{"prompt": "Does my work permit allow me to work for any employer in Canada?", "completion": "It depends on the work permit you have. Most work permits are tied to a specific employer. They will only allow you to work for the employer on the permit. In some situations, you can get an open work permit, which does not include a specific employer. An open work permit allows you to work for any employer in Canada unless the employer: is listed as ineligible on the list of employers who failed to comply with the conditions, or offers, on a regular basis, striptease, erotic dance, escort services or erotic massages."}
{"prompt": "Where do I find out if the employer who offered me a job is an eligible employer?", "completion": "The IRCC website has a list of employers who failed to comply with the conditions. This list shows employers who may be ineligible to hire a temporary worker through either the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or the International Mobility Program. If you apply for a work permit to work for an employer listed as \u201cineligible\u201d, your application will be refused."}
{"prompt": "What happens if I want to work for an ineligible employer?", "completion": "Unfortunately, your application for a work permit will be refused."}
{"prompt": "How long can I work in Canada as a temporary worker?", "completion": "There is no set maximum amount of time you can work in Canada as a temporary worker. The length of time you can work depends on, the job offer from your employer, the length of time listed on your Labour Market Impact Assessment, if your employer needed to get one to hire you, how long your passport is valid for, If you will be working in Quebec as a temporary worker, you may need to get a Qu\u00e9bec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ). The CAQ will show the length of time you are allowed to work in Quebec. If you are exempt from the LMIA process, you don\u2019t need to get a CAQ."}
{"prompt": "What type of job offers does IRCC accept for physicians?", "completion": "IRCC accept the following job offers proof under the policy: an offer of employment has been made by the employer, a letter of conditional offer, an approved opportunity, or a contract for services. While your arranged employment should be full-time, the job offer does not need to explicitly state the position is full-time. The immigration officer may accept, for example, a declaration stating that you\u2019ll be working the required number of hours."}
{"prompt": "Which entities can issue job offers for physicians?", "completion": "One of the following entities must issue the job offer:a provincial or territorial government, a government agency, a government-appointed agency, such as a regional health authority, health care service delivery entity managed by government appointed members who oversee hospitals, long-term care facility, home care and public health service, provincial government ministry, department responsible for health care, children, family development, or corrections services, an organization providing health care, such as a hospital or a medical clinic."}
{"prompt": "The employer I work for temporarily in Canada wants to offer me a full-time job. Will I need a new LMIA for Express Entry?", "completion": "In most cases, your current employer does not need to re-apply if they already got a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to hire you. For example, they do not need to re-apply if: your work permit is still valid, if you still work for the same employer (in a skilled job) as listed on your work permit, or if you work in a job listed as TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3 in the 2021 National Occupational Classification, and that employer already got an LMIA to hire you before. If you are working in Canada on a work permit that does not need an LMIA, your employer doesn\u2019t need to get one to make your job offer valid. When you create your Express Entry profile, you can show that you have a job offer. If IRCC invite you to apply, you will need to submit a copy of the documents with your application. But, if you plan to work for a different employer and want job offer points (or a valid job offer for the Federal Skilled Worker or the Federal Skilled Trades programs), your new employer will usually need to apply for a new LMIA (unless the job is exempt)."}
{"prompt": "I work in Canada on an LMIA-exempt work permit. How do I get job offer points for Express Entry?", "completion": "It depends on why your permit is exempt from a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). Under Express Entry, some LMIA-exempt jobs count towards job offer points. For example, if you are working in Canada on a LMIA-exempt work permit that was issued under an international agreement or Federal-Provincial-Territorial agreement (or certain other cases), you don\u2019t need your current employer to get an LMIA for your job offer to be valid. If your work permit is LMIA-exempt for any other reason, your employer still needs to get an LMIA to improve your chances of being invited to apply. These exemptions apply to temporary workers, but not to Express Entry. A valid job offer supported by an LMIA could get you more points under the Comprehensive Ranking System. A work permit on its own is not a job offer, even if it is an open work permit. You need a written offer."}
{"prompt": "I am working in Canada on a post-graduation work permit. Do I need a Labour Market Impact Assessment?", "completion": "Not necessarily. If you are working in Canada on a post-graduation work permit, and have a valid job offer, your current employer will need to get an LMIA if you need one to meet the program requirements for the Federal Skilled Worker Program or the Federal Skilled Trades Program and your job is not exempt. If a job is exempt, it means your employer does not need an LMIA to support your job offer. If you are invited under the Canadian Experience Class, you don\u2019t need an LMIA to meet the program requirements. But to get additional points under the Comprehensive Ranking System, a valid job offer supported by an LMIA can give you that extra push in your score. This can improve your chances of being invited to apply. So in that case, your employer may want to get an LMIA, even though you don\u2019t need it to be eligible."}
{"prompt": "Can I count my work as a teaching assistant toward the work experience requirement?", "completion": "You may be able to count experience as a post-secondary teaching and research assistant (please review code 41201 of the National Occupation Classification) toward the work experience requirement. This depends on the eligibility requirements for the Express Entry program you\u2019re applying to. If after submitting your Express Entry profile you are invited to apply, you must show that you did the job as described in the occupational description of the NOC, meaning that you did all the essential duties and most of the main duties listed. If you do not show that your experience meets the description in NOC, your application will be refused."}
{"prompt": "Can I count my work as a teaching assistant toward the work experience requirement in the Canadian Experience Class?", "completion": "To be considered under the Canadian Experience Class unfortunately, you cannot count work experience you gained while enrolled as a full-time student. Your work experience must have been gained while on a valid work permit, such as the Post-Graduation Work Permit. You must also have gained the equivalent amount of experience as someone who worked full-time for at least one year (1,560 hours) in the three years before you submit your Express Entry profile."}
{"prompt": "Can I count my work as a teaching assistant toward the work experience requirement in the Federal Skilled Worker Program?", "completion": "To be considered under the Federal Skilled Worker Program your work experience must have been full-time (or the equivalent in part-time hours), worked continuously and paid, for at least one year in the same occupation."}
{"prompt": "Do I need a permanent job offer for Express Entry?", "completion": "No. A valid job offer for Express Entry only needs to be for 1 year or more. Job offers must still be: in the NOC TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3, they also need to be from one employer for the FSW or CEC, or up to two employers for the FST supported by an LMIA (if you need one) or be for a candidate that is exempt from needing one."}
{"prompt": "What makes a job offer valid under Express Entry?", "completion": "Generally, a valid offer is for a job that is full-time and non-seasonal, the job also lasts for at least 1 year and is in a skilled job listed as TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 in the 2021 National Occupational Classification. A job offer must also be in writing, and must set out details of the job they are offering you, such as your pay and deductions, your duties as well as the conditions of employment, like your hours of work. In most cases, a valid job offer must be supported by a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). The employer has to apply for one from Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada. If they get a positive LMIA, they must give you a copy and a written job offer. In some cases, your employer does not need an LMIA to support your job offer. Under Express Entry, a valid job offer will give you additional points in the Comprehensive Ranking System. Please keep in mind that a work permit on its own is not a job offer, even if it is an open work permit. It's also important to note that, a job offer is not valid if your employer is: an embassy, high commission or consulate in Canada, or on the list of ineligible employers on the IRCC website. If your employer is not eligible, does not get a positive LMIA, or is not LMIA-exempt you will not meet the requirements of a valid job offer for arranged employment."}
{"prompt": "What makes a job offer valid under Express Entry for physicians?", "completion": "If you\u2019re a physician with a job offer in Canada IRCC introduced a temporary public policy for foreign national physicians who were invited to apply for permanent residence through Express Entry on or after April 25, 2023, and submitted an application and also have a job offer to provide publicly funded medical services in Canada. Under the policy, job offers to physicians needs to be valid under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) even if the job being offered is not continuous and does not last for at least 1 year after IRCC issue your permanent resident visa and the new policy also allows you to earn points for arranged employment under the FSWP selection factors toward your total Express Entry score in the Comprehensive Ranking System CRS."}
{"prompt": "What does IRCC mean by Primary Occupation?", "completion": "Your primary occupation means the job you have experience in (within the last ten years) and want to base your immigration application on, if you are invited to apply."}
{"prompt": "How do I find my National Occupation Classification (NOC) code?", "completion": "National Occupation Classification (NOC) code is the number the job is listed under in Canada\u2019s official job classification system. You can find the NOC code and title for a job on the IRCC website"}
{"prompt": "Why didn\u2019t I get points for my job offer in Express Entry?", "completion": "To get points from the Comprehensive Ranking System for a job offer in Express Entry, your employer will usually need to get a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA). You should only answer \u201cYes\u201d to the question \u201cDoes [your name] have a job offer in Canada?\u201d if: a Canadian employer (or up to two for the Federal Skilled Trades Program) has offered you a full-time, non-seasonal job for one year or more and that job offer is supported by an LMIA, OR the job is exempt from needing an LMIA. If you are currently working in Canada but have not been offered a job that is supported by a LMIA (or is exempt from needing one), you should: answer \u201cNo\u201d and create a Job Match account in Job Bank."}
{"prompt": "I am working in Canada on a valid work permit. Does this count as a job offer?", "completion": "No, a work permit is not a job offer. A job offer is valid if your current or future employer: has made a written offer to give you a full-time, non-seasonal job for one year or more if you are accepted as a permanent resident and has a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from Employment and Social Development Canada (or the job is LMIA-exempt). This applies if you are in Canada or nor. There are only two reasons that an employer making you a job offer does not need to get a new LMIA: if you are already working for them with a work permit based on that LMIA or if you work in a job that does not need an LMIA."}
{"prompt": "There is no National Occupation Classification (NOC) code on my work permit. What should I put in my Express Entry profile?", "completion": "If there is no National Occupational Classification (NOC) code on your work permit, you should find and use the NOC code of the job you are currently doing in Canada. Please confirm this on the IRCC website."}
{"prompt": "If I am waiting for a new work permit and I have job offer points, do I have to remove the job offer from my Express Entry profile?", "completion": "\u201cImplied status\u201d means you can stay in Canada and keep working while IRCC make a decision on your application. If you have implied status, and have applied to renew your work permit, you can keep working for the same employer under the same conditions. You are still eligible for job offer points during this time. If you are invited to apply, your Express Entry profile answers will be carried forward to your online application for permanent residence. It will show that you have a valid work permit supported by an LMIA (if you need one) in a NOC TEER 0 Major Group 00 job. You will not need to change the answers.You must submit a copy of your LMIA with the application if your work permit was supported by an LMIA. Please take note, the points you can get for a job offer has changed.

{"prompt": "What work experience can I count towards the Federal Skilled Trades Program\u2019s two-year requirement?", "completion": "In the Federal Skilled Trades program, work experience in a trade can only count if you are qualified to independently practice that trade in the region where you got your work experience. If you are qualified in one country, you might work in another country that has different rules for practicing your trade. In that case, the work experience from the second country will only count towards the two-year work experience requirement if you also met the requirements to practice there independently.
